Data_Minning_and_Visualizalizing_Patterns_with_Python

Introduction
===========

Data mining is the extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and
potentially useful information from data. It is applied in a wide range
of domains and its techniques have become fundamental for several
applications.
This Refcard is about the tools used in practical Data Mining for finding
and describing structural patterns in data using Python. In recent years,
Python has become more and more used for the development of data
centric applications thanks to the support of a large scientific computing
community and to the increasing number of libraries available for data
analysis. In particular, we will see how to:
• Import and visualize data
• Classify and cluster data
• Discover relationships in the data using regression and
correlation measures
• Reduce the dimensionality of the data in order to compress
and visualize the information it brings
• Analyze structured data
Each topic will be covered by code examples based on four of the
major Python libraries for data anal
